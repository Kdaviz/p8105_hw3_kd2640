Problem 1
=========

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the results of each):

``` r
data("instacart") 
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
   arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

The instacart dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns in the data. Each row contains information about an item that was ordered. The variables include the order information such as order id, reorders, order day of week, etc. The variables also give information about the item such as product name, product id, aisle, department, etc.

``` r
 instacart %>% 
   group_by(aisle) %>% 
   summarize(n = n()) %>% 
   filter(n > 10000) %>% 
   ggplot(aes( x = n, y = aisle, color = aisle)) +
  geom_point()
```

  knitr::kable()
```

Problem 2
=========

-   do some data cleaning
-   format the data to use appropriate variable names;
-   focus on the “Overall Health” topic
-   include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
-   organize responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”

``` r
data("bfrss_smart2010") 

brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
rename("state" = "Locationabbr",
       "county" = "Locationdesc"
       ) %>% 
  mutate(
    county = str_sub(county, 5)
  ) %>% 
     mutate(
     Response = factor(Response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
   ) %>%
   arrange(desc(Response)) %>% 
  filter(Topic=="Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-Question,-(Confidence_limit_Low:GeoLocation)) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

#### Question 2.1

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(Year %in% "2002") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_location >= 7) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 2
    ##   state n_location
    ##   <chr>      <int>
    ## 1 CT             7
    ## 2 FL             7
    ## 3 MA             8
    ## 4 NC             7
    ## 5 PA            10

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(Year %in% "2010") %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_location >= 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 x 2
    ##    state n_location
    ##    <chr>      <int>
    ##  1 CA            12
    ##  2 CO             7
    ##  3 FL            41
    ##  4 MA             9
    ##  5 MD            12
    ##  6 NC            12
    ##  7 NE            10
    ##  8 NJ            19
    ##  9 NY             9
    ## 10 OH             8
    ## 11 PA             7
    ## 12 SC             7
    ## 13 TX            16
    ## 14 WA            10

In 2002 the states that had 7 or more locations were Connecticut, FLorida, Massachusetts, North Carolina , New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In 2010 the states that had 7 or more locations were California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Washington.

#### Question 2.2

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic will help)

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(Response == "Excellent") %>% 
  select(Response, Year, state, Data_value) %>% 
  group_by(Response, Year, state) %>% 
  summarise(avg_data_value = mean(Data_value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y= avg_data_value, color = state))+
  geom_line()
```

#### Question 2.3

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(Year %in% c("2006", "2010"), state == "NY") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Response, y=Data_value, color=Response)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .5) +
  facet_grid(~Year)  + 
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

Problem 3
=========

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During observation periods, the devices measure “activity counts” in a short period; one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock observations.

``` r
accel_data = read_csv("~/Desktop/p8105_hw3_kd2640/data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minutes",
    names_prefix = "activity_",
    values_to= "counts"
  )  %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday = day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")) %>% 
  mutate(
   minutes = as.numeric(minutes)
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
  accel_data %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(counts)) %>% 

 ggplot(aes(x = week ,y = total_activity, color = day)) +
  geom_line()
```

<img src="P8105_hw3_kd2640_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  mutate(
    hour = minutes %/% 60) %>%
  group_by(hour, day, week) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(counts)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = total, color = day)) +
  geom_line()
```
